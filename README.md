Project Summary:
In this XN-Project, we collaborated with Kids At Risk Action (KARA) as a group of five members: Aadira Anil Ramakrishnan, Lalitha Shiny Pulletikurthi, Mohit Saini, Pawan Arsh Pamidimukkala, and Venkata Akilesh Reddy Nakka. Our goal was to leverage data to raise public awareness and inform policy regarding the challenges faced by at-risk children in the United States. This project was conducted as part of the ALY6080 Integrated Experiential Learning course under the guidance of Professor Valerie Atherley.

Executive Summary:
Our project focused on the dataset provided by KARA, spanning the years 1930-2017, detailing missing, mistreated, and neglected children across America. The aim was to provide an easily comprehensible visual format that evaluates the effectiveness of Child Protective Services (CPS) and highlights the demographics and circumstances of these children. Through this extensive dataset, KARA seeks to influence public opinion and legislative action to improve child welfare.

Project Highlights:
A.) Data Preparation and Analysis:
1. We began with data collection from reputable sources, followed by a thorough cleaning process to remove null values, reducing the dataset from 2834 to 2503 entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python to uncover significant patterns and trends.
3. The primary objective was to identify key metrics to understand overall performance and guide future actions.

B.) Key Findings:
1. Geographical Discrepancies: States like California and cities such as Los Angeles exhibited the highest number of missing cases, predominantly among females.

2. Gender Disparity: Females accounted for 64.7% of the missing children, highlighting the need for gender-sensitive interventions.

3. Ethnic Distribution: White children constituted the largest group (45%), followed by Hispanic (25%) and Black children (18%).

4. Incident Types: "Endangered Runaway" was the most common case type, underscoring critical areas for intervention.

C.) Recommendations:
1. Public Awareness: Utilize visual data from "AMERICA'S CHILDREN IN 100 CHARTS" to inform the public and policymakers.
2. CPS Improvement: Employ data-driven strategies to allocate resources effectively and train CPS staff on gender-sensitive and culturally competent practices.
3. Policy Advocacy: Promote region-specific strategies and gender-specific policies to address disparities.
4. Community Engagement: Collaborate with advocacy organizations and academic institutions for further research and stakeholder feedback.
5. Long-Term Impact Studies: Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate the effectiveness of child welfare policies and advanced analytics for proactive measures.

Project Execution:
Our team worked cohesively, dividing responsibilities to handle the complex challenges within the child welfare system. Ethical standards were maintained throughout the project, especially in managing sensitive data. Continuous stakeholder feedback refined our research focus and methods, ensuring alignment with the needs of at-risk children and the organizations supporting them.

Future Research:
Further investigations will explore advanced data analysis techniques, such as machine learning, to identify new trends and intervention points. Collaborative research efforts will enhance our understanding and approach to addressing the concerns of at-risk children effectively.

Conclusion:
By implementing these recommendations, KARA can better utilize data on missing children to raise awareness, influence policy, and improve the effectiveness of CPS, ultimately safeguarding and supporting vulnerable groups.
